	<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> Hello I am Ayokemi Popoola, I am 20 and live in Los Angeles California. Im
  a CD major and third year. At CSUMB i am on the track and field team, I enjoy
  painting and going to the beach with frineds.I recently been binge watching
 alot of netflix and just rollerskating with my dogs Max and Leah.  Im lowkey
 nervous about this class but I know at the end I will enjoy learning new things
 .

  <p> My names is Yulitsa Pantoja and I live in Greenfield California with my
    family.  Some fun activities I enjoy doing is draw a bit, playing video
    games, reading, and watching shows, and being with my cats.  My cats names
    are Kirby and Chi and they are both actually siblings and I got them in
    October 2014 when they were kittens.  The game I'm currently enjoy playing
    is Animal Crossing New Horizons.  It will be fun learning how to code and
    design websites.
